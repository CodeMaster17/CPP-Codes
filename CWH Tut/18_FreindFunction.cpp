/*
Properties of freind function ;
1. Not in the scope of class
2. Since it is not in the scope of the class, it cannot be called directly by creating the object of that class but can be called/invoked without use of any object

3. Usually contains objects as arguments
4. Can be declared inside public or private secrtion of the class
